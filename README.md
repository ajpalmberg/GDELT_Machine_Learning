The various files added in this project are largely used for data aggregation from various sources. GDELT has a free API, and stock data was gathered using POLYGON.IO and THETADATA. These providers had the best price for market data for my needs. This code was partially written by AI (Should be pretty obvious) however a large amount of human work was required to stitch it together. I have not set it up to work on a different device, thus you will have to put in your own file names. If you do use this, plan to have at least a terabyte of storage readily available. Results were inconclusive.
